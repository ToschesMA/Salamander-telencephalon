Cross species integration 3 datasets.txt is the Seurat data integration pipeline, including regression

build cell type tree.Rmd is to build a hierarchical clustering tree after integrated analysis

comparative_analysis_mastercode_labeltransfer.Rmd is my own personal backup, includes code that I used to generate the datasets for comparison (e.g. cleanup/downsampling of mouse data) and label transfer
